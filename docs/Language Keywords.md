# SIN Documentation

## Language Keywords

This document is meant to serve as an overview to all of the SIN language keywords. They are divided up into sections according to their purpose.

## Statement Keywords

The following keywords are those which can be used to begin statements.

### Symbols

* `def` - defines a block of code to be associated with a [function](Functions) or [struct](Structs)
* `decl` - declares a function or data
* `alloc` - allocates data of a given type
* `construct` - constructs a struct type _(Note: this feature has not yet been implemented)_
* `free` - frees the given memory back to the environment
* `let` - assignment keyword; always copies data
* `move` - move keyword; copies references when possible, otherwise performs a copy of the data

### Control Flow

* `if` - defines a condition that, if true, will result in the following statement or scoped block to be executed
* `else` - declares a block to be executed if the condition is not true
* `while` - defines a condition that, while true, will cause the execution of the following statement or scoped block
* `for` - defines a loop to iterate a specified number of times _(Note: this feature has not yet been implemented)_
* `call` - alternative to `@` when used in call statements
* `pass` - used to pass control to a new subroutine

### Miscellaneous

* `asm` - inline assembly

## Expression Keywords

The following keywords may *not* be used to begin a statement, but may be required as additional information to statements (e.g., type information in allocations).

### Operators

Note that all *logical* operators use keywords while the bitwise operators use symbols.

* `and` - logical and
* `or` - logical or
* `xor` - logical exclusive-or
* `not` - logical not
* `as` - typecast operator (operates like in Rust)

### Data Types

#### Fundamental Types

* `int` - integral types (default 32-bit)
* `float` - floating-point types (default single-precision, 32-bit)
* `char` - a single character
* `string` - a string type
* `struct` - a user-defined struct type
* `ptr` - a 64-bit pointer type
* `ref` - a 64-bit reference type
* `array` - a homogeneous array of data
* `tuple` - a heterogeneous tuple
* `proc` - a procedure _(not yet implemented)_

#### Width and Sign

* `long` - doubles the data's width (only for numeric types)
* `short` - halves the width (only for numeric types)
* `unsigend` - specifies the data should be unsigned
* `signed` - specifies the data should be signed

#### Variability and Location Specifiers

* `const` - compile-time constants (value known at compile time)
* `final` - runtime constants (may not be modified once assigned)
* `static` - data that should be allocated at compile time
* `dynamic` - data that should be allocated at runtime on the heap; may be, but does not have to be, variable-width; may not be `const`, but may be `final`
* `constexpr` - specifies an expression may be evaluated at compile-time (uses only literals and `const` data)
* `extern` - data to be made globally available

#### Attributes

* `len` - the length (number of elements) of data
* `size` - the size (number of bytes) of data
* `var` - variablility

#### Other

* `this` - the first parameter for struct methods
* `null` - a null pointer literal
* `unmanaged` - indicates a pointer should not be managed by the MAM
